Design and develop an ecommerce store using Next.js. It should have the following:

[x] A Products page (where all the products are listed)
[x] Minimum of 4 different products (4 matcha options)
[x] The page should have a relevant `h1` element
[x] Each product (incl. product name and image) needs to be contained in an anchor element (a link) with an attribute of `data-test-id="product-<product id>"`
[x] This link will lead to its single product page
[x] The header (described below) needs to have a link to the products page with the HTML attribute `data-test-id="products-link"`
[x] A page for each single product (when you click on the product it goes to this page) with ability to add a quantity to the cart
[x] The single product URL needs to contain the `id` (eg. `/products/<product id>`)
[x] The product name needs to be directly inside an `h1` element (it should be the only `h1`)
[x] The product image needs to be in an `img` element with the HTML attribute `data-test-id="product-image"`
[x] The product price (without any currency symbol or thousands separator) needs to be directly inside an element with the HTML attribute `data-test-id="product-price"`
[x] The quantity input needs to have the HTML attribute `data-test-id="product-quantity"`
[x] The starting quantity should be `1`
[x] The add to cart button needs to have the HTML attribute `data-test-id="product-add-to-cart"`
[x] Clicking this button will add the amount from the product quantity input to any quantity of this product already in the cart
[x] For example, if the amount in the product quantity input is `2` and the existing quantity of this product in the cart is `3`, then after clicking the button, the quantity of this product in the cart will become `5`
[x] Negative quantity values should not be possible
[x] A Cart page (containing a list where products appear when you click on the "Add to cart" button on the single product page), which also shows the total price of all products
[x] Each product needs to be contained in an element with the HTML attribute `data-test-id="cart-product-<product id>"`
[x] Inside the product element:
[x] the product name needs to be be visible
[x] the quantity needs to be visible, as the only content inside an element with the HTML attribute `data-test-id="cart-product-quantity-<product id>"`
[x] the product subtotal needs to be visible (price Ã— quantity)
[x] the remove button needs to have the HTML attribute `data-test-id="cart-product-remove-<product id>"`
[x] The total price (the number without any currency symbol) needs to be directly inside an element with the HTML attribute `data-test-id="cart-total"`
[x] The checkout button needs to have the HTML attribute `data-test-id="cart-checkout"`
[x] Negative quantity values should not be possible
[x] Clicking on the checkout button should navigate to the checkout page
[x] A Checkout page which shows the total and asks for shipping and payment information
[x] The first name input needs to have the HTML attribute `data-test-id="checkout-first-name"`
[x] The last name input needs to have the HTML attribute `data-test-id="checkout-last-name"`
[x] The email input needs to have the HTML attribute `data-test-id="checkout-email"`
[x] The address input needs to have the HTML attribute `data-test-id="checkout-address"`
[x] The city input needs to have the HTML attribute `data-test-id="checkout-city"`
[x] The postal code input needs to have the HTML attribute `data-test-id="checkout-postal-code"`
[x]The country input needs to have the HTML attribute `data-test-id="checkout-country"`
[x] The credit card input needs to have the HTML attribute `data-test-id="checkout-credit-card"`
[x] The expiration date input needs to have the HTML attribute `data-test-id="checkout-expiration-date"`
[x] The security code input needs to have the HTML attribute `data-test-id="checkout-security-code"`
[x] The form should prevent submission with any of the above fields being empty
[x] The Confirm Order button needs to have the HTML attribute `data-test-id="checkout-confirm-order"`

- Privacy: don't save user information (payment or other personal information) anywhere (unless you have a privacy policy and are creating a real ecommerce store)

[x] Clicking on the Confirm Order button should empty the cart and navigate to the Thank You page
[x] A Thank You page
[x] The page title should include `Thank you for your order`

[x] A header with a link to the Cart, showing the number of items in the cart
[x] This header needs to appear on all pages
[x] The header needs to use the HTML `<header>` element
[x] The number of items is the sum of the quantity of all products (eg. if you have 2 apples and 3 bananas in your cart, the number of items is 5)
[x] The number of items needs to update when you add or remove items from the cart
[x] The link needs to have an HTML attribute `data-test-id="cart-link"`
[x] The count needs to be contained in an element with the HTML attribute `data-test-id="cart-count"`

This project is to build an Ecommerce store on your own - don't use an all-in-one solution like [Next.js Commerce](https://nextjs.org/commerce).

## Cookies

[x] Use a cookie called `cart` to store information about what the user has added to their cart

- Security: Prevent the user from making changes to cart data they shouldn't be able to (eg. prices). Remember: users can edit any information that is in the cookie.

[x] ## Database
[x] Create a PostgreSQL database and table(s)
[x] Connect to and query information from this database

[x] ## TypeScript / JSDoc
[x] Write at least 2 pages with props and 4 other non-migration, non-database files in TypeScript (type the React props like in [the cheatsheet](https://learn.upleveled.io/courses/bootcamp-pern/modules/cheatsheet-typescript-jsdoc/))

## Tests

This project should also include tests written for the following functionality:

[x] E2E: Add to cart, change quantity and remove from cart
[x] E2E: Checkout flow, payment page, thank you page
[x] Unit: Test function that combines the product data from the database with the product quantity data from your cookie
[x] Unit: Test function for updating quantity in item of cookie (eg. adding an item to the cart that already exists)
[x] Unit: Test cart sum function

- Set up GitHub Actions to automatically test your code

## SEO

[] Add titles to all pages
[] Add meta descriptions to all pages

## Deploying

[] Deploy to [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) ([cheatsheet](https://learn.upleveled.io/courses/bootcamp-pern/modules/cheatsheet-deployment/#deploying-a-nextjs--postgresql-app-to-flyio))

## Documentation

[] Create a readme with:
[] Title
[] Description
[] List of all technologies used
[] 1 or 2 screenshots
[] Setup instructions
[] Deployment instructions

## Stretch goals

- Loading indicator (text or animation) that displays during loading of a page, including an HTML element with the attribute `data-test-id="loading"`

- Allow changing quantity of items in the cart
- Add a unique `slug` to each product to allow for URLs like `/products/<product slug>`

  - Also change all of the `data-test-id` attributes on all pages to use the `slug` instead of the `id`, eg. on the Products page, `data-test-id="product-<product slug>"`
  - A `slug` is a URL-friendly string that is used to identify a product (eg. "apple-iphone-11-pro-max") - hyphens instead of spaces, all lowercase, no special characters

- Add validation for data entered by the user

  - Add frontend validation with error messages
  - Add server-side validation to check the information being submitted by the user and return errors

  - Write unit test for server-side validation functions

- Save the cart data to a database table in addition to a cookie (eg. using a join table)
- Add search functionality
- Make authentication system with users
- Allow admin login to edit and delete products
- Use Next.js API routes for returning information from the database
- Use GraphQL to send information between React and the backend
- Set up Stripe as a payment handler between the Checkout and Thank You page
  - Don't skip creating the full Checkout page, including all shipping and payment form fields - this is still a required part of the project
  - To add Stripe to the checkout page, a button or anchor element should be visible with the HTML attribute `data-test-id="stripe-pay"`
  - Clicking on this button should send the user to a Stripe payment form, where it accepts the credit card details (this page needs to accept the `4242 4242 4242 4242` Stripe test card number)
  - Upon submitting the Stripe payment form, the user needs to be directed to the Thank You page on your website
- Right after [creating your first (empty) Git commit](https://learn.upleveled.io/courses/bootcamp-pern/modules/cheatsheet-command-line/#5-create-and-push-an-initial-commit), create a new branch. Use this branch to [open a pull request on GitHub](https://learn.upleveled.io/courses/bootcamp-pern/modules/cheatsheet-git-github/#opening-pull-requests)
- Accessibility: Fully keyboard- and screenreader-accessible
- Create a favicon that identifies your app: (see [Generating and Adding Favicons](https://learn.upleveled.io/courses/bootcamp-pern/modules/cheatsheet-design-ux/#generating-and-adding-favicons))
- Test and further improve your SEO (meta tags, performance, image optimization, sitemaps, etc)
