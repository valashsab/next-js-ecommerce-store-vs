          Drinking one cup of matcha is roughly the equivalent of drinking 10
          cups of green tea. Itâ€™s not jittery like coffee or energy drinks and
          gives you that kick you need while lasting throughout your day. Itâ€™s
          also super healthy for you (antioxidants and L-theanine amino acid)!

          We source our very own proprietary blend of Matcha Mafia ceremonial
          grade matcha directly from Uji, Japan, which is home to the oldest and
          most traditional matcha farms in the world. Our matcha is always made
          from freshly ground first harvest green tea leaves. When it comes time
          for harvest the green tea leaves are shaded, picked and sorted by
          quality, de-veined and de-stemmed (to remove bitterness), air dried,
          slow ground into a fine powder, then packaged and sent straight to us
          within days. All this work so you can enjoy the finest quality matcha
          every day!
